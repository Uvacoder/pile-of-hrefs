# Pile of hrefs
 This project is an experiment in trying to find the best way for me to collect links for things I want to read later, or for things that might be useful in the future.

 The project uses Airtable as backend, Vue for templating and [Sergey](http://sergey.cool) (a small static site generator). I've created some [notes at Notion](https://www.notion.so/superterrific/Pile-of-hrefs-80f1667163bd41a2ac69fb3c1b4326e7).

 Feel free to fork if you think you could use this type of set-up.
