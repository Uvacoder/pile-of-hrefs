# Pile of hrefs
 This project is an experiment in trying to find the best way for me to collect links for things I want to read later, or for things that might be useful in the future.

 The current version of this project uses [Airtable](https://airtable.com) as backend with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). The previous version used Vue for templating and [Sergey](http://sergey.cool) (a small static site generator).
